## &#9741; &nbsp; Overview

Given a collection of documents, that are scholarly articles about coronavirus, and given a
query, created by people with not no expertise in the medical domain, the objective of this
project is to provide to the user a ranked list of the documents that are considered relevant
for the specified query. The relevance assessment of a document with respect to the query
is divided into three categories: not relevant, partially relevant and relevant.
